<p class='noin'>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I am taking the liberty of writing you this letter since I read your
published volume, &ldquo;Logical Control: The Computer vs. Brain&rdquo;
(Silliman Memorial Lecture Series, 1957), with the hope that you can
perhaps offer me some advice and also publish this letter in the
editorial section. Your mathematical viewpoint on the analysis between
computing machines and the living human brain, especially the conclusion
that the brain operates in part digitally and in part analogically,
using its own statistical language involving selection, conditional
transfer orders, branching, and control sequence points, et cetera,
makes me feel that only you can offer me some information with logical
<i>arithmetic depth</i>.</p>

<p>The questions raised in this letter are designed principally to reach
the embryonic and juvenile scientists &hellip; the <i>scientists-elect</i>, so to
speak. (I think the &ldquo;mature scientists&rdquo; are irretrievably
lost.) For many reasons, some of which will be explained in the
following paragraphs, I think that it is of the greatest importance that
some stimulatable audience be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
reached. As yet, the beginners have no rigid scientific biases and thus
may have sufficient curiosity and flexibility about the world in which
they live to approach experimentation with a mind devoid of &ldquo;the
hierarchy of memory registers which have programmed in erroneous
data.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What I have to say will not surprise nor shock <i>you</i>, or those who are
at present engaged in scientific investigation. In fact, I have read
many science-fiction stories that deal with the same problem. Perhaps
that is the only way that it can be approached, through the medium of a
story? Yet why not present it for what it may be? Let me tell it my own
way, and then, please, let me have your <i>coldly logical</i> opinion.</p>

<p>As to my background, I am a graduate student in the Zoology Department
of a midwestern university working toward a Master&rsquo;s degree, or
actually a doctorate&mdash;we can bypass the M.S. if we choose&mdash;in the field
of Cellular Physiology. My sponsor is an internationally known man in
the field. The area of research that I have selected is concerned with
the effects of physical and chemical agents on the synthesis of nucleic
acids of the cell. Obviously, this is a big field, and I hope to select
from among the different agents, one or two that will give
&ldquo;positive results.&rdquo; I have been doing active research for
about half a year testing the different agents. As for the <i>fundamental</i>
questions raised, I am positive that it would make <i>no</i> difference in
what field of science I were to work.</p>

<p>By now I have had enough course work to realize that when performing any
assigned laboratory exercise&mdash;they should not be called
experiments&mdash;even of a cook-book type, little or even major
discrepancies arise, and <i>always on the initial trials</i>, no matter how
carefully one works! As you are probably aware, the teaching assistant
in charge of the lab or the instructor, generally runs through the
exercise before the class does in order to get the &ldquo;bugs&rdquo;
out of it&mdash;I am deliberately generalizing, since the above holds for all
of the laboratory sciences&mdash;so when the student gets confusing or rather
contradictory results, the instructor can deftly point out the error in
the setup or calculations, or <i>what have you</i>. He may <i>even</i> indicate
what results may be expected. <i>The last is critical.</i> Similarly other
students in the laboratory usually have friends who have had the course
before and know what results are expected&mdash;<i>this technique is frowned
upon</i>. Or one may consult textbooks and published papers. (This, by the
way, is known as <i>library research</i>, and is generally conceded to be
indicative of the superior student, especially if he points out the fact
that he is <i>so interested</i> that he just had to delve into the
literature.) By any technique, <i>the expected results are always
obtained</i>. <i>Always. And by everyone.</i> The initial confusions&mdash;that some
<i>honest</i> students perpetuate&mdash;are easily <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
brushed aside as errors due to inexperience, sloppiness, lack of
initiative, stupidity of congenital sort, et cetera, et cetera.</p>

<p>Since being a teaching fellow, even simple cook-book experiments
don&rsquo;t seem as cook-bookish. Some pretty weird things have happened
when I tried out an exercise prior to the class. Fortunately, I was
taught to keep data&mdash;in duplicate: indelible purple Hexostick original
and carbon copy. These, <i>vide infra</i>, are a few of such happenings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c'>Elementary General Physiology Laboratory:</p>

<p class='hi'>1. Initial maximal vagal stimulation:<br />

<i>Expected results</i>: inhibition of heart beat.<br />

<i>Obtained results</i>: one series of increased heart beats. (Possible
explanation: I missed the vagus nerve)????</p>

<p class='hi'>2. <i>Frog nerve-muscle preparation</i>:<br />

<i>Expected results</i>: a single muscle twitch.<br />

<i>Obtained results</i>: a beautiful nerve twitch.<br />

(Explanation: Eyesight? How can <i>nerves</i> twitch?)??</p>

<p class='hi'>3. <i>Hypotonic hemolysis</i>:<br />

<i>Expected results</i>: red blood cell destruction.<br />

<i>Obtained results</i>: crenation.<br />

(Explanation: switched salt solutions <i>unconsciously</i>)?????</p>

<p class='hi'>4. <i>Curarized muscle preparation</i>:<br />

<i>Expected results</i>: a synaptic block with no response of nerve when
stimulated.<br />

<i>Observed results</i>: a typical strychnine response, violent
<i>tetanus</i>, et cetera.<br />

(Explanation: again, I switched bottles)????</p>

<p class='hi'>5. I shall avoid the obvious mention of mishaps with mechanical or
electrical pieces of equipment. I assure you there were similar
deviations in initial attempts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since I realize that you are preparing a paper on <i>Memory Registers:
Stimulation Criteria</i>, for the VIth Annual International Meeting of the
Society of Theoretical Biomathematicians in London, and are short of
time, I shall avoid going into the same kind of detail as the above for
other Biology Labs, and get into the real heart of the thing &hellip; the
research problem. (After all that is what both of us are interested in.)
By the way, please send me a reprint of the paper when it comes out.</p>

<p>I guess I am really hepped up on this, because I&rsquo;ve just got to
point out for emphasis other incidences usually of a type that involved
missing a whole organ in dissections or a tissue structure in histology
only on the <i>first</i> study, and then re-reading the assignment&mdash;after
knowing what to look for&mdash;and <i>subsequently finding it exactly where it
is said to be</i>. (Ever hunt for an unknown quality&mdash;or quantity?) <i>So it
was there all the time</i>, sloppy technique? Or is this branching at a
control point? <i>cf.</i> LC: C. vs. B. p. 251.</p>

<p>To get back to my thesis research, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the pieces of equipment that I have been using in the research are
fairly standard in physiological research: a Beckman spectrophotometer,
a Coleman photometer, a van Slyke amino nitrogen apparatus, a Warburg
respirometer, pH meters, Kjeldahls, Thunbergs, et cetera. Mostly,
I&rsquo;m in the process of getting used to them. Also there is a high
voltage X-ray generator, U. V. source and other equipment for
irradiation purposes. We also have an A. E. C. license so that we can
get at least microcurie amounts of the usual isotopes for
radioautographic work.</p>

<p>Now the literature in my area is pretty controversial. (You can
appreciate <i>that</i>, especially since Bergbottom at the Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute bombarded you with criticisms of your theories.) Different and
actually contradictory results have been obtained for the same substance
in the same organism, <i>e. g.</i> alkaline phosphatase in the frog liver
cell (Monnenblick, &rsquo;55, Tripp, &rsquo;56, and Stone, &rsquo;57).
To give an example, when I start a run for respiration effects using a
Warburg I don&rsquo;t know what results to expect. Whenever this has
been the case, my results have been confusing &hellip; to say the least.</p>

<p>On nitrogen-mustard treated cells, in some instances the controls
respired significantly <i>more</i>&mdash;even with a statistical analysis of
variance&mdash;in some instances the <i>experimentals</i> respired significantly
more; and in other cases the respiration for both was <i>exactly</i> the
same&mdash;even <i>closer</i> than the expected deviations that should be found in
any random population. One run, the blank run, <i>containing no cells</i> &hellip;
and grease-free &hellip; consumed the greatest amount of oxygen. To cut this
letter short, the same inconstancies apply to other trials that I have
made. Whenever I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect, and particularly
where the literature was controversial, my results have been completely
haywire.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was not happy with this so I discussed it with other
graduate students. They have all encountered the <i>same thing</i>! But most
professors won&rsquo;t admit this to be true and merely tell me that my
technique is lousy. If anything, I am an overly careful worker. Why is
it when I <i>know</i> what results are expected, I get comparable results
even on the <i>first</i> trial?</p>

<p>Remember, <i>I obtained the expected results</i> when the literature
wasn&rsquo;t confused or when my sponsor&mdash;a most important man in my
life&mdash;gave me a clue as to what kind of results to expect. <i>Only then.</i></p>

<p>Now this is the heart of the matter&hellip; The obvious explanation is the
lack of experience. But, and this is what haunts me &hellip; <i>what if those
so-called contradictory results are meaningful</i>? What if they were
executed with care&mdash;<i>and they were</i>&mdash;and are not the results of
sloppiness or inexperience? <i>What if a nerve can twitch?</i></p>

Editor, Journal of the National Academy of Sciences,<br />

Washington, D. C.</p>

<p class='noin'>Dear Dr. Von Engen:</p>

<p>I would like to thank you for your encouraging letter and advice. I
agree completely with your statement that science has a long way to go
before we can explain the various inconsistencies that crop up in
research. But I certainly can&rsquo;t see how the letter is far too
&ldquo;unsophisticated&rdquo; for inclusion in the <i>Letters to the
Editor</i> portion of your journal. While your letter should have calmed
me, I feel even more strongly now after a year of research about the
matter than I did before. I have deliberately postponed answering your
letter until I had more <i>facts</i>.</p>

<p>I now find that I have accumulated&mdash;as you suggested&mdash;three distinctly
conflicting groups of data on nucleic acid synthesis of frog liver
cells:</p>

<p>1. There is a conversion of ribonucleic acid to desoxyribonucleic acid.</p>

<p>2. There is a conversion of desoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid.</p>

<p>3. The synthesis of both types of nucleic acid are independent of each
other. (In addition, I have some data &hellip; that I don&rsquo;t want to
think about too much &hellip; that shows that there is absolutely no nucleic
acid in the liver cell.) Thus, these data all accumulated by
experimental work, support all three hypotheses. Moreover, the
literature supports <i>all three hypotheses</i>. I intend to go to the Woods
Hole, Massachusetts Marine Lab this summer with my sponsor and get some
new ideas there, especially since Professor Gould M. Rice from the
University of London will be there presenting a seminar series on his
work in nucleic acid synthesis in <i>Oryzias</i>.</p>

<p>The point is not that there is a conflict in the data, but that the data
conflict because there is a conflict in my mind and in the literature.
<i>Don&rsquo;t you see it?</i> As you said on page 20 of &ldquo;Logical
Control: Computer vs. Brain&rdquo;: &ldquo;the order-system&mdash;this means
the problem to be solved, the interaction of the user&mdash;is communicated
to the machine by &lsquo;loading&rsquo; it into the memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p class='noin'>Dear Dr. Bob:</p>

<p>Again, many thanks for your letter&mdash;and encouragement. I especially
treasure the inscribed copy of &ldquo;Logical Control: Computer vs.
Brain,&rdquo; and the current reprint. I am sorry that I didn&rsquo;t
get an opportunity to get down to Washington en route to Woods Hole and
talk over the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
whole thing over a bottle of beer, <i>dark beer</i>. From what I hear of the
demands on a first-rate mathematician&rsquo;s time these days, you
should be grateful that I didn&rsquo;t get to see you, because I would
have monopolized <i>all</i> your time. I appreciate your generosity in
extending the invitation as a rain check to me.</p>

<p>Your mention of the Duke School of &ldquo;psychology&rdquo;&mdash;my
quotes&mdash;leaves me cold. It&rsquo;s too obvious and puts the cart before
the horse. The important point that I was trying to make dealt not with
the &ldquo;possible parapsychological&rdquo; manipulation of equipment
or the materials <i>a la</i> telekinesis to produce the desired results, <i>but
that our Science may not be studying natural phenomena and trying to
interpret them at all</i>. The point, to get it down in black and white, is
that our &ldquo;Science&rdquo;&mdash;yes, quotes&mdash;may be <i>inventing</i> the
reality that it is supposedly studying. <i>Inventing the atoms, molecules,
cells, nuclei, et cetera &hellip; and then describing them, and in the
description giving them reality.</i></p>

<p>While I was at Woods Hole I had some really good bull sessions about
this very thing. I realize now that I may have been falling into the
trap of solipsism, &ldquo;who watches the quad,&rdquo; et cetera, type
of thing. Incidentally, my research is finally beginning to fall into
shape. My sponsor and I had some pretty good sessions about it, and some
of the screwy results I wrote you begin to make sense. I had the good
luck to talk to an outstanding man in the field of nucleic acid
synthesis and he was quite enthusiastic about the caliber of our work.
He feels quite strongly&mdash;but has no real evidence&mdash;that the synthesis of
both types of nucleic acid are independent of each other and has pointed
out some significant references that I did not know about. I&rsquo;m
anxious to buckle down and really lick this nucleic acid problem &hellip; in
time for a June degree.</p>

<p><span class='ralign'>Cordially,</span><br />
<span class='ralign'>Jonathan</span><br /></p>

<p class='noin'>P.S.</p>

<p>Please send me a reprint of your lecture on &ldquo;Memory
Banks&mdash;Transistorized Neurones.&rdquo; The lecture was ingenious, but
there are some biological phenomena with which I don&rsquo;t agree.
Remember, I&rsquo;m the biologist. Honestly, Doc, don&rsquo;t you
think&mdash;<i>entre nous</i>&mdash;that your idea that a living organism, can be
compared with automata in picking up informational items and processing
them simultaneously in parallel, rather than in series, is naif?</p>

<p class='noin'>Dear Dr. Von Engen:</p>

<p>I apologize for not answering your letter sooner. I assume you were
pulling my leg when you suggested that I make a science-fiction story
out of &ldquo;the confused ideas of a beginning graduate student.&rdquo;
You might <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
give <i>your</i> idea of a &ldquo;possible science-fiction story&rdquo; to
one of your acolytes that has some small experience in the field of
writing&mdash;not science. I am afraid that your other suggestions are
not germane to the problem of nucleic acid synthesis and metabolism, a
problem that has been occupying <i>all</i> my time. In fact, I&rsquo;ve been
doing with three to four hours of sleep these days. With the kind of
concentration that I can offer the problem, there is no question that
the data are falling into line, and our research is going rather well.
We will show, I hope, fairly conclusively that there is little or no
interconversion between the two types of nucleic acid synthesis in the
cell.</p>

<p>Despite your ingenious mathematical approaches for stimulation criteria,
in biological research&mdash;a very abstruse field&mdash;even your multiplex
machines with elaborate means of intercommunication are not
sophisticated enough&mdash;or ever will be&mdash;to cope with the complexities
inherent in the numerous interacting biosyntheses on the subcellular
ultratopographical level of protoplasm.</p>

<p class='noin'>My dear Professor Von Engen:</p>

<p>From the tenor of your last letter it is quite evident that there has
been a radical change in your originally sound and inspired ideas, and
which clearly indicates to me that a discussion and exchange of basic
concept would be fruitless. I&rsquo;m rather hurt that you question my
integrity with the statement about the &ldquo;slick, calculating,
career-minded cult of Ph. Deism.&rdquo; Moreover, I would appreciate, if
possible, the return of my previous correspondence.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that I am totally inept, for I have been awarded a
predoctoral fellowship that will support me during the remainder of
graduate school. In addition, I am being seriously considered for a
faculty position at an outstanding Eastern University upon completion of
my thesis. Should you be interested, we now have an article in press on
the Journal of Cellular Physiology entitled: &ldquo;Nucleic acid
synthesis in the frog liver cell: A definitive study.&rdquo; We have
found substantial evidence which demonstrates that there is no
interconversion of the two types of nucleic acid.</p>

<p>I cannot help but comment about your recent paper in <i>Scientia</i>&mdash;I do
not believe that it is at all possible to devise computers which can
handle the species of data which we obtain. Your data being less
complex, of course, may fit.</p>

<p><i>Naturally</i>, I have your confidence in the entire matter.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
